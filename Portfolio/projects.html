                Orchidee was a project developed with Symfony. It is a web application that we built for a real customer.
                Basically, our client wanted an application that had 5 main features: display an employee's schedule,
                allow to take appointments, have multiple types of accounts, show account information and give her
                business a web presence. Indeed, she was using only Facebook before.
                <br>
                While working with Symfony, we improved our knowledge about how MVC works.
                We also learned a new framework from scratch since we had no classes about it.
                We had to do a lot of research and a lot of effort in order to properly make a web-application with Symfony.

                My first game! This final project for my gaming class made me so happy! I finally worked on a game. However,
                it wasn't as easy as expected. Running dog is a basic side-scroller about a dog trying to escape from his master,
                however, it isn't easy!
                <br>
                In that class a learned a lot about how we actually create a video game and how to make it fun. Therefore,
                my friend and I tried our best to put what we learned into practice. Most of the game is hand-made,
                yes the dog too! We are no professional pixel artists, but we still had fun pretending so.
                <br>
                This game was developed in C# and we used a lot of common things from Unity such as prefabs.

                What kind of shop are we? was a semester-long project. However, the difficulty was that we did not
                fully create it. Indeed, the code was already given. Easy? Not at all, the code was full of mistakes
                and we had to correct it in order to make it work. We also had to add our personal touch.
                <br>
                This project was developed with PHP and it implements everything we learned in the course.
                From variable declaration to how to handle cookies and sessions, everything is in there.

                "Automate the boring stuff with Python" showed me the basics of Python and how of a multipurpose language it is.

                Then I bought a book for beginners. "Basic security testing with Kali Linux" taught a lot about a lot.
                It covers enough material for beginners in multiples domains such as Wifi hacking, password decryption

                I tried my best to follow the labs in the book which was rewarded with a lot of new things learned.

                This book showed and explained to me the many commands that

                referring to this book: "Social engineering, the art of human hacking". Really, I am not really
                knowledgeable about the psychology field, but this book did a pretty good job talking about multiple
                actions and comportments a human has and should have in order "outplay" the target. Many techniques and
                interesting facts about the human comportment allowed me to be able to read and understand a little better my surrounding.

                circuits and all have a unique characteristic. In other words, did you know we could identify your
                router just by calculating the flashing of the lights? Crazy right! Well now, as the author suggested,
                I will have to tape mine...just to be sure.

                I will be honest with you, I never finished that book and dropped it in the first chapter.
                I was really looking forward to starting reading it, but I never could. It is too advanced.
                This book starts directly with assembly, which I had no knowledge until I first opened it.
                However, that did not stop me, it actually gave a starting point, x86. I indeed took a small
                course through a website that introduced me to the x86 architecture and showed me enough assembly
                to understand what is happening.  I've even ended up doing some logical bombs with GDB, but again that was not enough.

    Yes, for a little more than a year now, I study Japanese. My motivation first came from the fact that
    I wanted to read a specific set of books. However, while doing so, I realized that it will take me more
    than a summer to learn it, it will take something like around years, before being fluent in one of the hardest language.
    This personal project, aside from the readings previously mentioned, opened my eyes and mind about how to see the world and how different is every culture.
    How unique each one of them is what makes it hard and at the same time interesting. Learning Japanese really is a project I plan working on my whole life.
    <br>
    Not only, I am also determined to pass the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) exams. All from 5 to 1.
