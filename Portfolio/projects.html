                Orchidee was a project developed with Symfony. It is a web application that we built for a real customer.
                Basically, our client wanted an application that had 5 main features: display an employee's schedule,
                allow to take appointments, have multiple types of accounts, show account information and give her
                business a web presence. Indeed, she was using only Facebook before.
                <br>
                While working with Symfony, we improved our knowledge about how MVC works.
                We also learned a new framework from scratch since we had no classes about it.
                We had to do a lot of research and a lot of effort in order to properly make a web-application with Symfony.

                My first game! This final project for my gaming class made me so happy! I finally worked on a game. However,
                it wasn't as easy as expected. Running dog is a basic side-scroller about a dog trying to escape from his master,
                however, it isn't easy!
                <br>
                In that class a learned a lot about how we actually create a video game and how to make it fun. Therefore,
                my friend and I tried our best to put what we learned into practice. Most of the game is hand-made,
                yes the dog too! We are no professional pixel artists, but we still had fun pretending so.
                <br>
                This game was developed in C# and we used a lot of common things from Unity such as prefabs.

                What kind of shop are we? was a semester-long project. However, the difficulty was that we did not
                fully create it. Indeed, the code was already given. Easy? Not at all, the code was full of mistakes
                and we had to correct it in order to make it work. We also had to add our personal touch.
                <br>
                This project was developed with PHP and it implements everything we learned in the course.
                From variable declaration to how to handle cookies and sessions, everything is in there.

                One of my friends once told me "Python is the hacker's" language. Which got me curious and also a
                little scared at the same time. I wanted to learn that "hacker's" language, but I thought that
                I still didn't know enough to do so. Well, this book really showed me how easy Python is and how complex it can get.
                "Automate the boring stuff with Python" showed me the basics of Python and how of a multipurpose language it is.

                I've played a lot with it by myself, but it was obvious that I was going nowhere.
                Then I bought a book for beginners. "Basic security testing with Kali Linux" taught a lot about a lot.
                It covers enough material for beginners in multiples domains such as Wifi hacking, password decryption
                and some of the most used tools in the field such as Nmap and Metasploit.
                Excellent reading to begin somewhere.

                This is the next volume after "Basic security testing with Kali Linux". Since I had a wonderful experience with the first one,
                I thought I would give it a shot for something a little more advanced. There was indeed some section of the book that
                I had a hard time understanding since I did not have the backend knowledge about, but it was still fun to see how things work.
                I tried my best to follow the labs in the book which was rewarded with a lot of new things learned.

                Nmap is one of the most used tools in the security filed for reconnaissance. The tool itself has evolved a lot thanks to
                the many contributors. Not only does it scans networks, but it can also now search for vulnerabilities while doing so!
                This book showed and explained to me the many commands that
                Nmap has and are used in order to scan and secure networks. It was a really interesting experience to scan my own computers.
